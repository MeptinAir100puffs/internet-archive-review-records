# Internet Archive Review Records

This repository contains primary records of public reviews posted on Internet Archive items.

Due to the dynamic rendering of reviews on Internet Archive, such reviews cannot be reliably captured by third-party web archiving services (e.g., Wayback Machine, archive.today).

Each record here documents:
- the review content
- the target Internet Archive item
- the posting date

This repository serves as a factual log for archival and documentation purposes only.
